--Merge join requires both inputs to be sorted on join keys/merge columns,
--or both input tables have clustered indexes on the column that joins the tables
--and it also requires at least one equijoin (equals to) expression/predicate.

--Because the rows are pre-sorted, a Merge join immediately begins the matching process. 
--It reads a row from one input and compares it with the row of another input. 
--If the rows match, that matched row is considered in the result-set 
--then it reads the next row from the input table, does the same comparison/match and so on
--or else the lesser of the two rows is ignored and the process continues this way until 
--all rows have been processed.

--A Merge join performs better when joining large input tables (pre-indexed / sorted) 
--as the cost is the summation of rows in both input tables as opposed to the Nested 
--Loops where it is a product of rows of both input tables.
